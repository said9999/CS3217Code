1.Design :	The design of this physical engine is using MVC pattern.	M: World and Models(rectangles)	V: StoryBoard	C: ViewController and RectangleViewController	Each rectangle is controlled by an rectangleViewController. Its delegate is RectangleViewController, which means when the model is modified, the view will be 	modified as well.	
	RectangleViewController is added into ViewController. Both of them know the information about models and StoryBoard. They keep updating models and their views 	since the world start running.	
	The world knows nothing about UI information. It only stores the information of models(rectangles) here. And it has a method called "run" to start simulating the 	real world.	
	A CollisionDetector is inside the world. It continues tracking every collision in this world and stores all contact points into its contactPointsList.	
	A ContactPoint knows all information of two colliding rectangles. Hence, it will apply the impulse on these two rectangles, after all contact points are added into 	the contactPointsList.


2.How to extend
	We can create a new object model, and inherit all other shapes to this model. Each	model has a tag called “shape”, then we can identify each object by this tag.

3.Testing Strategy

	Black-box Test:
		1.add one object, see it falls down.
		2.add a bottom, see two object colliding.
		3.add two objects and one bottom, see three objects colliding.
		4.add all bounds, add 6 rectangles, to see colliding.

	Glass-box Test:
		PLS cancel all statement related to uiaccelerometer first!!!!
		Write down 3 unit tests in the project. 


4. Bonus Question
	1. over 50+ hours
	2. communicate with friends more, and reading some design pattern books
	3. maybe provide some hints how to debug this project, since it's difficult for
	 me to debug.
